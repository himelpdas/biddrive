note pythonanywhere has most modules built in, but since this is technically a shared host you can't use pip to install to root python installation
therefore python anywhere allows installation in a local directory pip install --user
sometimes a local pip installation might not manifest immediatley, therefore you should restart the server, if that doesn't work see if running the local web2py.py webserver does the trick.
